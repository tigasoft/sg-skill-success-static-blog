### **1. Avoid “References Available Upon Request”**

You should leave off the phrase “references available upon request” on your resume. It just shows that you are hesitant, or worse, too lazy, to provide this information to the recruiter or hiring manager.

When you include the references list section on your resume, you should include a list of professional contacts. This shows that you are comfortable and confident about your performance in your previous work.

To set you apart from other applicants and show your creativity, you can add blurbs or quotes from your references and include those on your references list.

### **2. Decide how many references to include**

The number of references you will include in your list depends on your career level. For example, if you are a new employee who has no experience yet, you may pick three references. However, if you already have years of experience and applying for a senior position, you may need to provide a long reference list.

### **3. Select the references you will include on your list**

Before you add names and contact information to your references list, you should gather all your professional contacts’ names, titles, organizations, and contact details. Once you have your list, you should ask permission from those people first. Remember that you should give them at least two weeks’ heads up before submitting an application for a new job.

When selecting references, you should consider contacts that are:

* Your current or former colleagues, direct reports, team leaders, supervisors, or managers.
* Those with whom you have a strong professional relationship. People who are able to affirm the quality of your work, your character, and your accomplishments.
* Professionals whom you trust and you know have the ability to answer tough questions about you as an employee.

The best way to ask a person to be on your reference list is by giving them information about the job you are applying for. Then ask them if they are willing to provide positive feedback about your work. Remember that you should be comfortable with the people you will include in your references list.

### **4. List your references in order of importance**

You need to choose your references wisely. Most employers will only ask for three to five references. Thus, you carefully select your most important references. These people should be those who can discuss your skills and abilities for the position you are applying for.

List the reference who will likely give you great recommendations at the top of your reference list. It is also best to choose references who work in the same industry as the job position you are applying for.

### **5. Format your references list correctly**

Using an appropriate format for your references in a consistent order helps recruiters and hiring managers glean information. This also helps protect your references’ privacy because you are only sharing what contact information is needed.

You can list each of your references with the following information and format.

* Name
* Current Job/Position
* Company
* Phone Number
* Email Address

There is no need to add the work and home addresses of your references. It will also help if you add a heading, such as “references” or “professional references.”

### **6. Dedicated references list page separate from your resume**

References list should never be included on your resume. Always put them on a separate page and as the last page on your resume. This is because your references list is your supporting information, and you can easily not include this section when your prospective employers do not need this information.

Even if your reference list is on a separate page, it should still have the same font, color scheme, and layout as your resume. The same rule and concept also apply in writing your cover letter.

The “[Create the Ultimate Resume Package to Stand Out](https://www.skillsuccess.com/course/stand-out-resume/)” online course provides a very unique and professional resume package to potential employers. It will cover how to write and resume and create the layout and design of your resume, cover letter, and business card.

**Additional important things to consider:**

Your references can make or break your chances of getting a job. Here are some important things to be aware of when referencing people.

* It is discouraged to include family members on your references list.
* Avoid listing people with whom you had a conflict with.
* Confirm with your chosen reference if they are comfortable with your request.
* Keep your references up to date.
* Don’t forget to thank your references.

References are not always supposed to be on a resume, so you may opt-out of including this section. However, there will be some occasions that you may need to have it. So, it is best that you have already prepared your references list, put it on a separate sheet, and match it with the font and style on your resume and cover letter. Most importantly, you need to be intelligent in choosing your references before applying for jobs.
